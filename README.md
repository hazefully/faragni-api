Faragni is a social cataloging website for movies that allows you to explore movies that are similar to other movies you love, and recommend movies to user with a taste similar to yours.

## How It Works

Faragni uses a deep learning model to learn the hidden patterns in the movies you loved, and predict how much you would love other similar movies. Faragni also allows you to follow other users, and to send and recieve recommendations from other users, making it easier than ever for people to share the movies they would love with each other.

## Features

- Follow other users to see their activity and their public ratings

- Get smart recommendations from our deep learning model, tailored just for you.

## Technologies

Faragni's backend is developed using Ruby on Rails, and its frontend is developed using Angular with Typescript. The deep learning model is written using Python, and integreated with the backend. The frontend and the backend are both deployed on Heroku.
